## Usage

To use any of the searching algorithms implemented in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/searching-algorithms-cpp.git` (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username).
2. Navigate to the directory of the algorithm you want to use.
3. Compile the C++ file using `g++ algorithm_name.cpp -o algorithm_name` (replace `algorithm_name` with the name of the algorithm you want to use).
4. Run the executable using `./algorithm_name`.
